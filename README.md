# GIS-Portfolio
Portfolio for Advanced GIS, Heinz College, Spring 2021

# About me
2nd year MS Public Policy Management - Data Analytics student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh

# What I hope to learn
Throughout this course, I hope to build upon my existing GIS skills and continue to acquire tools that will help me with equity enhancing work in local government work. I've recently taken a class on Tableau, and found the geographic visualizations a bit limiting in functionality, so I'm looking forward to jumping back into ArcGIS to create more complex visualizations! In my tableau class, I did my final project on creating data visualizations for 10 years of abortion data in the US. I hope to be able to expand upon that work (or to gain the skills to be able to expand on that work) by creating a map that illustrates the inter-state travel that some individuals must complete to gain access to abortion.
