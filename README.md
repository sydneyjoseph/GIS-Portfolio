Portfolio for Advanced GIS, Heinz College, Spring 2021

# What I hope to learn
Throughout this course, I hope to build upon my existing GIS skills and continue to acquire tools that will help me with equity enhancing work in local government work. I've recently taken a class on Tableau, and found the geographic visualizations a bit limiting in functionality, so I'm looking forward to jumping back into ArcGIS to create more complex visualizations! In my tableau class, I did my final project on creating data visualizations for 10 years of abortion data in the US. I hope to be able to expand upon that work (or to gain the skills to be able to expand on that work) by creating a map that illustrates the inter-state travel that some individuals must complete to gain access to abortion.

Create a page that includes the color palette you used, a screenshot of your stylized map, and a summary of your design decisions.  You should include an outline of your process from beginning to end, which you'll use to help communicate the steps you took to the organization later. 
Organization: Clean Water Action
Sample Image and Color Palette:

Design Decisions
After retrieving a color palette from Adobe for the sample image, I used the Map Styling Wizard to edit the map features to my color palette. Because Clean Water Action’s color palette includes several shades of blue, it immediately became apparent that green would have to be the primary base color, or else it could look misleading in distinguishing between bodies of water and land masses. Light blue was used for roadways, a darker blue was used for waterways, and dark blue was used for points of interest. 
Additionally, because most of the colors are so dark it became clear that words should be a light white with a dark grey outline in order to provide contrast to any and all dark colors beneath. 

This process resulted in this final stylized map:
